# Welcome to my customized version of NxOgre ! #
This is a PhysX wrapper for Namuh based on NxOgre.
It includes several projects:
 * flour is a tool that converts generic 3D objects to PhysX compatible assets (aka "cooking tool")
 * Detritus is the version of NxOgre released just before BuggySwires
 * BuggySwires is the last version of NxOgre, and the base version for this spin-off
 
The NxOgre project is composed of:
 * NxOgre itself, plus its tutorials.  NxOgre is the PhysXbside of the wrapper.
 * Critter, which is the Ogre3D side of the wrapper.
 
### How to get it up & running ?
You need visual studio to compile the source code if you made modifications.
Find in the choosen project the build folder, then open the sln file according to your visual studio version.
If you want to see your modifications in action, you should update the libraries of Namuh so it uses your version, recompile Namuh and launch it.
