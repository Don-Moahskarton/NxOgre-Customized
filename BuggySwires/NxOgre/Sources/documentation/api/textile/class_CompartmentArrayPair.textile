p(d). Compartments don't have a userData property. So Scene will store a copy
of the compartment pointer and the representive pair. This isn't too efficent
but hopefull you won't be fetching over billions of compartments every frame.


h2(fn constructor). <a name='CompartmentArrayPair'></a>CompartmentArrayPair

p(d). Internal do not use.
