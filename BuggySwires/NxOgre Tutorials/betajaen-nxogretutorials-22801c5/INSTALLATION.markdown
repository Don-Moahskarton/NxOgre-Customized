Installing the tutorials
========================

Before compiling make sure you have the NXOGRE_DIR and OGRE_HOME environmental variables correctly set.

When compiling the tutorials, they will auto-install themselves into the debug or release version samples folder, along with the NxOgre and PhysX dlls and the nxogre.zip media file.


Running the tutorials
=====================

Simply run the `SamplesBrowser.exe` (or `SamplesBrowser_d.exe`), if everything is correctly installed. You shall see them under the Physics section.
